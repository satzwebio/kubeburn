Perfect — you’re making a strong case that MTC (Migration Toolkit for Containers) is not suitable as a backup/restore solution in OpenShift. Below is a clear, professional summary you can use in a design discussion, justification note, or email to management/application teams.

🚫 Why MTC (Migration Toolkit for Containers) is Not a Suitable Backup & Restore Solution

1. MTC is Designed for Migration, Not Backup

The primary purpose of MTC is cluster-to-cluster migration (e.g., OCP 4.x to 4.y or platform changes), not continuous data protection or point-in-time backups.

It lacks native scheduling or retention capabilities required for operational backups.


2. No Native Automated Backup or Restore Mechanism

MTC does not provide automated or recurring backups — all actions (backup, restore, plan creation) are manual or require custom automation.

Any automation (e.g., via Ansible Tower or Jenkins) has to be custom-built and maintained, introducing complexity and risk.


3. Custom Automation = Infra Ownership Burden

To automate backups with MTC, infra must write and maintain custom jobs, scripts, and Tower templates.

This includes:

Creating/maintaining Migration Plans for each namespace.

Managing custom schedules for each application.

Monitoring and troubleshooting failed jobs.


These are application data management activities, not infrastructure responsibilities.


4. Elevated Access & RBAC Complexity

MTC operations (migration plan creation, backup execution) require cluster-admin or elevated RBAC roles.

Integrating with Ansible Tower requires service accounts with broad privileges — raising security and compliance concerns.

Proper RBAC segregation between app and infra teams becomes difficult to maintain.


5. Manual Configuration for Each Namespace

Every new namespace needs:

Manual creation of MTC MigPlan and MigStorage objects.

Manual linking to storage backends (MinIO, PVCs, etc.).


This is not scalable for clusters with many namespaces or frequently changing workloads.


6. Limited Storage Flexibility

MTC expects a migration storage backend (like MinIO or S3) to hold intermediate backup data.

Since your environment only has MinIO within the OpenShift cluster, the data:

Is not off-cluster, thus not protected from cluster-level failures.

Increases storage and performance dependency on the same cluster being “backed up.”



7. Operational Overhead

Every new application or namespace requires:

Manual plan creation.

Template updates in Tower.

Schedule coordination with app teams.


Troubleshooting failed MTC migrations or restores is complex, involving multiple CRDs (MigPlan, MigMigration, MigStorage).

Overall, infra ends up acting as a data operations team, which is not its mandate.


8. No Incremental or Differential Backups

MTC performs full data copy/migration each time.

This leads to inefficient use of bandwidth and storage, making it impractical for regular backups.


9. No Versioning, Retention, or Restore Validation

MTC doesn’t maintain versioned backups or retention policies.

There is no native mechanism to validate or test restores automatically.


10. No Native Monitoring or Reporting

Lacks built-in alerting, reporting, or dashboarding for backup success/failure.

Infra team would need to build additional observability (e.g., Prometheus rules, Tower job monitors).


11. Operational Risk

Using MTC as a backup solution introduces unsupported operational patterns.

Red Hat supports MTC for migration use cases — not as a day-2 backup product.

In case of failure or data corruption, support coverage could be limited.

✅ Summary — Infra Perspective

Infra team should not own or maintain application data backup operations.

MTC introduces manual steps, automation overhead, elevated access, and maintenance burden.

It is architecturally misaligned with the purpose of backup and restore (it’s a migration tool).

A proper backup solution (e.g., OADP/Velero, TrilioVault, Kasten K10, Portworx Backup) should be evaluated for automated, policy-driven, namespace-scoped backups with app team ownership.
