Cohesity Backup for OpenShift – Application Team Guide
Purpose of This Document

This document provides application teams with a high-level understanding of how backups work for OpenShift namespaces using Cohesity, what is protected by default, and how to request backup onboarding or special configurations.

High-Level Architecture Overview

Cohesity is deployed on enterprise on-premises infrastructure

OpenShift clusters have secure network connectivity to the Cohesity platform

The OpenShift Platform team has already:

Integrated Cohesity with OpenShift

Registered supported OpenShift clusters with Cohesity

If your namespace belongs to a cluster not yet registered, the platform team will take care of cluster registration as part of onboarding

👉 Application teams do NOT interact directly with Cohesity
All onboarding and configuration is handled via the OpenShift Platform / SRE team.

How Namespace Backup Works (Simple Flow)

Your application runs in an OpenShift namespace

The namespace is labeled by the platform team for backup

Cohesity automatically:

Discovers the namespace

Backs up Kubernetes objects and persistent data

Backups run based on the policy you selected

Once enabled, no application changes are required for standard backups.

How to Request Backup for Your Namespace

To enable backup for your namespace, submit an SRE request in the service portal with the following details:

Required Information	Description
Cluster Name	OpenShift cluster where your app is deployed
Namespace Name	Namespace to be protected
Backup Policy	Choose one of the standard policies listed below

Once approved:

The platform team applies the required labels

Your namespace becomes protected automatically

What Is Protected by Default

When a namespace is onboarded:

✅ All Kubernetes objects, including:

Deployments, StatefulSets, Services

ConfigMaps, Secrets

Jobs, CronJobs, Routes, etc.

✅ All Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) in the namespace

⚠️ No action is required from the application team unless you have special requirements (see below).

Backup Policies

A backup policy defines:

How often backups are taken

How long backups are retained

Standard Policies Available
Policy Name	Backup Frequency	Retention
Daily – 4 Hour Retention	Once per day	4 hours
Daily – Standard Retention	Once per day	As per enterprise retention standard

👉 Application teams must choose one of the above policies during onboarding.

For compliance or application-specific needs, exceptions can be discussed (see Special Cases).

Backup Types Supported

Cohesity supports two backup mechanisms for OpenShift:

1. CSI-Based Backup (Default & Recommended)

This is the default backup method used for all namespaces unless specified otherwise.

Key Benefits

Uses Kubernetes CSI snapshots (storage-native)

Faster backup and restore

Minimal performance impact on running applications

Crash-consistent backups

Supports application quiescing via hooks

Best option for stateful and production workloads

Fully supported by all OpenShift storage classes used in the enterprise

Quiesce Support

Allows execution of:

Pre-backup commands (e.g., pause writes, flush buffers)

Post-backup commands (e.g., resume application)

Useful for databases and stateful services

👉 Recommended for most applications, including databases.

2. File-Based Backup (Special Use Only)

File-based backup operates by copying files from mounted volumes instead of using storage snapshots.

When File-Based Backup May Be Needed

Legacy or non-CSI compliant storage (rare)

Applications that cannot tolerate CSI snapshots

Very specific application behavior or vendor limitations

Temporary workaround during troubleshooting

⚠️ File-based backups:

Are generally slower

Have higher runtime impact

Are not the enterprise default

👉 Must be explicitly requested and approved.

Special Cases & Exceptions

If your application has non-standard requirements, mention them clearly in the SRE request.

1. File-Based Backup Request

If you require file-based backups, provide:

Reason for the request

Application details

Any vendor documentation (if applicable)

2. Quiesce Mode (Pre/Post Hooks)

If your application needs commands to run before or after backup:

Provide:

Pre-hook command(s)

Post-hook command(s)

Container name (if multiple containers exist)

Common use cases:

Databases

Applications with in-memory state

3. Change in Policy Type

If the standard policies do not meet your needs:

Explain the business or compliance requirement

Platform team will review feasibility and retention impact

4. Excluding Specific PVCs or Resources

If certain PVCs or resources should NOT be backed up:

Specify:

PVC name(s) or resource type(s)

Reason for exclusion (cache, temp data, rebuildable data, etc.)

What Happens Next

The platform team will:

Review your request

Validate compatibility

Reach out if clarification is required

Once approved:

Backup is enabled

No further action is required from the application team

Summary

Backup is namespace-based

CSI-based backup is the default and recommended option

All objects and PVCs are protected automatically

Special requirements are supported through a request process

Application teams do not manage Cohesity directly
